# Archive Vision Tasks

As per Kurosh Dini's description of *vision tasks* in Creating Flow with OmniFocus, this script will, when passed a string that is to be an updated name for a vision task through osascript or LaunchBar, archive the name of the task in the task's note field along with a date and then update the name of the task with the string that was provided.
